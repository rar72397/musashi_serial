Notes on UPD7201A Serial Chip 

MPSCC (Multiprotocol Serial Communication Control) - Data sheet refers to chip by this name

We are only working with Asynchronous, not HDLC (High-level Data Link Control) or Synchronous Modes

each channel has their own set of registers that act almost exactly the same
channel B one extra status register SR[2], whose contents are then used in control register CR[2]
channel A status register SR[2] is unused, however I'm keeping the sizes of the registers the same for consistency

DCD: Data Carrier Detect - input goes low to indicate the presence of valid serial data at RxD (in channels A or B)

Tx Byte Counter:
There should be two different counters, one that has how many bytes are currently in the transmit buffer (which need to be sent),
and one that tracks how many have been sent so far. Transmission (DMA requests), will be stopped when these two numbers are equal 
to each other.

Data Bus goes from processor to serial chip
Serial chip communicates with other devices via serial Tx/Rx 

Special Receive Conditions
-Receive overrun error
-Asynchronous framing error
-Parity error
-HDLC end of message (final flag received)

Latched: once a flag is set, will remain set until manually reset by error reset command

Parity Error and Receiver Overrun Error are latched
Others are not latched, follows each character available in receiver buffer

Definitions from ChapGPT
Vectored interrupt: In a vectored interrupt system, each interrupt source is associated with a specific memory address (a vector). When an interrupt occurs, the processor uses this address to jump directly to the corresponding interrupt service routine (ISR).

Nonvectored interrupt: In a non-vectored interrupt system, all interrupt requests are funneled to a single interrupt handler. The interrupt handler then needs to determine which interrupt source triggered the interrupt and execute the corresponding routine.
